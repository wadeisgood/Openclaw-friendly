description: Diagnose and fix OpenClaw GUI browser control on Linux desktops, especially when agent-controlled browser launch fails with errors like "Missing X server or $DISPLAY", Chrome CDP startup failure, or a systemd --user OpenClaw gateway that cannot open a visible browser window despite a working GNOME/KDE desktop session. Use when setting up controllable browser windows, repairing DISPLAY/WAYLAND/XDG environment propagation, or validating that OpenClaw-managed Chrome can launch under a desktop login session.

# Control GUI Setting

Use this skill to make OpenClaw's managed browser work on a real Linux desktop with a visible browser window.

## Quick diagnosis

Run these in order:

```bash
openclaw gateway status
openclaw browser status
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw start
```

Interpretation:

- If `browser status` says `enabled: true` and detects Chrome/Brave, the browser feature is installed.
- If `start` fails with errors containing `Missing X server or $DISPLAY`, the usual root cause is **not** "no desktop installed". It is usually that the `openclaw-gateway.service` user service did not inherit the desktop session environment.
- If `user` profile attach fails with `Could not find DevToolsActivePort`, that means attaching to the existing Chrome session is not ready; prefer fixing the managed `openclaw` profile first.

## Workflow

### 1. Confirm the browser feature itself is available

Run:

```bash
openclaw browser profiles
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw status
openclaw browser --browser-profile user status
```

Healthy signs:

- `enabled: true`
- a detected browser path such as `/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable`
- profile `openclaw` exists

If those appear, do **not** jump to reinstalling Chrome or OpenClaw.

### 2. Read the real failure from logs

Inspect the gateway log:

```bash
grep -nEi 'browser|chrome|chromium|cdp|devtools|playwright|mcp' /tmp/openclaw/openclaw-$(date +%F).log | tail -200
tail -n 160 /tmp/openclaw/openclaw-$(date +%F).log
```

Key signatures and meaning:

- `Missing X server or $DISPLAY`
  - Desktop GUI variables are missing from the OpenClaw service environment.
- `The platform failed to initialize. Exiting.`
  - Chrome tried to launch but could not access a display server.
- `Could not find DevToolsActivePort`
  - Existing Chrome attach failed; not necessarily the managed browser path.

### 3. Verify whether the machine actually has a desktop session

Check from a shell:

```bash
loginctl list-sessions --no-legend
loginctl user-status "$USER"
```

Look for evidence of a live desktop, for example:

- `org.gnome.Shell@wayland.service`
- `Xwayland :0`
- desktop portals or GNOME/KDE user services

If these exist, the machine **does** have a working GUI session. The issue is environment propagation into systemd user services.

### 4. Compare shell env vs systemd --user env

Run:

```bash
printf 'DISPLAY=%s\n' "$DISPLAY"
printf 'WAYLAND_DISPLAY=%s\n' "$WAYLAND_DISPLAY"
printf 'XDG_SESSION_TYPE=%s\n' "$XDG_SESSION_TYPE"
printf 'XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=%s\n' "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR"
printf 'DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=%s\n' "$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS"

systemctl --user show-environment | grep -E '^(DISPLAY|WAYLAND_DISPLAY|XDG_SESSION_TYPE|XDG_RUNTIME_DIR|DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS)='
```

Expected healthy `systemd --user` environment on GNOME Wayland often includes something like:

```text
DISPLAY=:0
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0
XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus
```

If `DISPLAY` / `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` are missing in `systemctl --user show-environment`, that is the main bug.

### 5. Import the desktop session environment into systemd --user

Run from a **desktop terminal inside the logged-in GUI session**:

```bash
dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_SESSION_TYPE XDG_RUNTIME_DIR DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
systemctl --user import-environment DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_SESSION_TYPE XDG_RUNTIME_DIR DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway.service
```

Notes:

- Restarting `openclaw-gateway.service` may interrupt the current chat/control session. That is expected.
- If the shell already lacks `DISPLAY`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, import from that shell will not help. Use a terminal that is definitely opened from the live desktop session.

### 6. Validate the repair

After the gateway restarts, run:

```bash
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw start
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw status
```

Success looks like:

```text
running: true
browser: chrome
```

At that point, the managed browser is ready and the machine-side setup is fixed.

## Decision guide

### Prefer the managed `openclaw` browser when:

- you want the most reliable automation path
- you do not need your normal daily browser profile
- you want a clean, agent-only browser window

### Prefer the `user` profile only when:

- you specifically need existing logged-in sessions
- you understand that existing-session attach is more fragile
- the user is present to approve attach prompts if needed

## AI-tool login and launch workflow on wade-desktop

When the user asks to open or use a specific AI tool (for example ChatGPT or another web AI product) on `wade-desktop`, use this workflow first.

### Default behavior

If the user says things like:

- open ChatGPT
- open a website
- enter a browser page
- use a specific AI tool

interpret that as: act on **`wade-desktop`** and prefer the OpenClaw-managed browser.

### Standard execution flow

1. Open the target site in the OpenClaw browser:

```bash
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw open https://chatgpt.com
```

2. Capture a snapshot and locate the relevant login / continue / signup entry point:

```bash
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw snapshot --limit 220
```

3. Use refs from the snapshot to interact with the page:

```bash
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw click <ref>
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw type <ref> "<text>"
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw press Enter
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw wait --text "<expected text>"
```

4. Repeat snapshot → inspect refs → click/type/wait until the page reaches the intended state.

### Credential boundary

The agent may assist with navigation, clicking, and field entry, but do not invent credentials.

If login requires any of the following, request or wait for the user’s real input/approval:

- email / phone
- password
- 2FA / OTP / authenticator code
- Google / Apple / Microsoft account confirmation
- device approval / security challenge

### Why this workflow exists

This avoids depending on whether the current messaging session exposes the `browser` tool directly. The control path runs on the machine itself through `openclaw browser`.

## Recommended control strategy for wade-desktop

When the goal is to directly control the browser on `wade-desktop`, prefer this order:

1. **Use `openclaw browser` as the primary control surface**
2. Use raw CDP only as a lower-level fallback
3. Treat Linux GUI automation on GNOME Wayland as a coarse fallback only

### Why `openclaw browser` should be the default

It provides a higher-level browser automation surface that already includes the pieces needed for reliable page interaction, such as:

- page open/start/status
- tab management
- waits
- snapshot refs / element targeting
- form interaction
- cookies / storage manipulation
- resize / device / geo / locale / timezone settings
- JS evaluation
- screenshots and other captured artifacts

This makes it a better day-to-day control layer than raw CDP and much better than fragile GUI click simulation.

### Raw CDP guidance

Raw CDP is feasible, but more fragile. If you use it directly, you must usually solve these yourself:

- target/tab selection
- wait strategy
- retry after render or navigation changes
- iframe handling
- visibility / scroll before click/type
- stable element addressing

Therefore, do not make raw CDP the default if `openclaw browser` is already available.

### GUI automation guidance

On GNOME Wayland, GUI automation is often limited or awkward compared with classic X11 tooling. Treat it as a backup for coarse operations, not as the preferred route for reliable page interaction.

## Browser tool access vs browser launch

Do not confuse these two problems:

1. **Machine/browser launch problem**
   - `openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw start` fails
   - fix desktop environment propagation, browser startup, and CDP reachability

2. **Agent tool exposure problem**
   - CLI browser works, but the current chat session still cannot call the `browser` tool
   - fix tool policy / agent routing / channel runtime exposure

If CLI works but the session still says it lacks `browser` tool access, treat that as a **tool exposure problem**, not a browser installation problem.

### Diagnose tool exposure problems

Check config first:

```bash
sed -n '1,260p' ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

Look for:

- global `tools.profile`
- any `tools.allow` / `tools.deny`
- per-agent `agents.list[].tools`
- channel/group overrides that may deny `browser`
- sandbox browser restrictions such as `allowHostControl`

Important interpretation:

- If global config does **not** deny `browser`, but the current session still cannot use it, the limitation may come from the channel/session runtime that exposed tools to this conversation.
- In that case, fixing `openclaw browser` on the host will let CLI/browser automation work, but may **not** automatically grant the live chat session the `browser` tool.

### Minimal machine-side fallback

Even when the current session lacks `browser` tool access, you can still open pages on the host with CLI:

```bash
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw open https://chatgpt.com
```

This is useful as an operational fallback while separately debugging why the session tool list does not include `browser`.

## Common mistakes

- Reinstalling Chrome before checking `systemctl --user show-environment`
- Assuming `Missing X server or $DISPLAY` means the whole machine has no desktop
- Trying to fix `user` attach first when the managed `openclaw` browser is still broken
- Restarting the gateway remotely and being surprised when the current control session drops
- Assuming a successful CLI browser launch automatically means the current chat session has the `browser` tool

## Minimal repair recipe

Use this when the machine clearly has a live GNOME/KDE desktop but OpenClaw cannot open a visible browser window:

```bash
dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_SESSION_TYPE XDG_RUNTIME_DIR DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
systemctl --user import-environment DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_SESSION_TYPE XDG_RUNTIME_DIR DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway.service
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw start
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw status
```

## Cleaning unused OpenClaw sub sections / historical session entries

Use this workflow when the OpenClaw UI still shows many old sub sections, branches, or historical session entries that are no longer useful.

### What usually causes the clutter

The UI can retain entries from session history even after the underlying runtime work is already dead. Common sources:

- old `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/*.jsonl`
- stale entries in `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/sessions.json`
- old tmux / ClawTeam runtime remnants (separate from UI history)
- `.reset.*` snapshot files that may still exist on disk

### Safe cleanup workflow

1. Identify the **current active session** and keep it.
2. List historical session files by recent modification time.
3. Back up old session files before deleting anything.
4. Remove old `.jsonl` session files except the current one.
5. Shrink `sessions.json` so only the current session entry remains.
6. Re-check the UI.
7. Only if needed, clean `.reset.*` leftovers separately.

### Example inventory command

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import os, time
base=os.path.expanduser('~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions')
current='CURRENT-SESSION-ID-HERE'
files=[]
for name in os.listdir(base):
    if name.endswith('.jsonl'):
        path=os.path.join(base,name)
        st=os.stat(path)
        files.append((st.st_mtime,name,st.st_size))
files.sort(reverse=True)
for mtime,name,size in files:
    sid=name[:-6]
    mark='KEEP-CURRENT' if sid==current else 'CANDIDATE'
    print(f'{mark}\t{time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", time.localtime(mtime))}\t{size}\t{name}')
PY
```

### Example cleanup command

Run only after confirming the current session id:

```bash
set -e
BASE="$HOME/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions"
BACKUP="/tmp/openclaw-session-backup-$(date +%F)"
CURRENT="CURRENT-SESSION-ID-HERE.jsonl"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP"
cd "$BASE"
for f in *.jsonl; do
  if [ "$f" != "$CURRENT" ]; then
    cp -a "$f" "$BACKUP/"
    rm -f "$f"
  fi
done
```

Then trim `sessions.json` to the active entry only.

### Important cautions

- Never delete the current live session file.
- Back up before deletion.
- Do not assume tmux cleanup alone will remove UI history.
- Treat `.reset.*` files separately; they are not the same as active session files.
